<h2 id="why-minimal-model-program">Why minimal model program?</h2>
<p><em>We want to classify all algebraic varieties!</em></p>
<p>But it’s <strong>impossible</strong>, we can not even classify all smooth algebraic varieties (or even manifold) up to homeomorphism :(</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Manifolds in dimension 4 and above cannot be effectively classified: Given two <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-manifolds (<span class="math inline">\(n \geq 4\)</span>) presented as CW complexes, there is no algorithm for determining if they are homeomorphic / diffeomorphic. This is due to the unsolvability of the word problem for groups. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_manifolds#Computability">Click Here</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence we have to find a better notation, just like homotopy, which is birational equivalence.</p>
<h3 id="examples-of-birational-transform">Examples of birational transform</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>normalization;</li>
<li>blow up;</li>
<li>Veronese map of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb P^n\times \mathbb P^m\to \mathbb P^{n + m}\)</span>;</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>But acturally they all look like blow up: birational equivalence between <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb P^1\times \mathbb P^1\subset \mathbb P^3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb P^2\)</span> is exactly the blow up of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb P^2\)</span>! So how important is blow up?</p>
<h3 id="theorem-hart-theorem-v.5.5">Theorem [Hart, Theorem V.5.5]</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T\colon X \to X'\)</span> be a birational transformation of <strong>surfaces</strong>. Then
it is possible to factor T into a finite sequence of monoidal transformations (blow down)
and their inverses (blow up).</p>
<hr />
<p>So now we are going to examine blow up. The self-intersection number of the exceptional divisor is <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>, and the converse also holds:</p>
<h3 id="theorem-castelnuovo-hart-theorem-v.5.7">Theorem (Castelnuovo, [Hart, Theorem V.5.7])</h3>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is a rational curve on a surface <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> with self-intersection number <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>, then there exists a surface <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and a birational morphism (monoidal transformation, i.e. blow down) <span class="math inline">\(f : Y \to X\)</span> such that the exceptional divisor corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is exactly <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thus, by continuously contracting exceptional divisors, one can simplify the surface until there are no rational curves with negative self-intersection left.<br />
The culmination of this idea is the <strong>Enriques classification</strong>, proposed in the 19th century: by using the Kodaira dimension, the genus, and the irregularity number, one can determine the corresponding minimal model.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, <strong>Kuni­hiko Kodaira</strong> rigorized the intuitive proofs of the Italian school using modern language, for which he was awarded the <strong>Fields Medal</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p>So now the question is: can we do the same for higher dimensional algebraic varieties? This is what minimal model program (mmp) talks about.</p>
<p>The difficulty in higher dimensions lies in the fact that the blow-up is not unique, and the notion of self-intersection no longer makes sense.</p>
<p>Until 1981, <strong>Shigefumi Mori</strong> solved <strong>Hartshorne’s conjecture</strong> and discovered that instead of considering self-intersection numbers, we can study the intersection with the canonical divisor <span class="math inline">\(K_X\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="theorem-contraction-theorem-smooth-version.">Theorem (Contraction Theorem, Smooth Version).</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a projective algebraic variety, and let <span class="math inline">\(F \subset \overline{NE}(X)\)</span> be a <span class="math inline">\(K_X\)</span>-negative extremal ray. Then, up to isomorphism, there exists a unique projective variety <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> and a unique morphism <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{cont}_F : X \to Z\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\((\operatorname{cont}_F)_* \mathcal{O}_Z = \mathcal{O}_X\)</span>, and for any irreducible curve <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{cont}_F(C)\)</span> is a point if and only if <span class="math inline">\(C \in F\)</span>.</p>
<p>Mori was awarded the <strong>Fields Medal in 1990</strong> for this result.<br />
Moreover, Mori’s original proof is difficult to generalize to dimensions four and higher. The higher-dimensional cases were later developed by <strong>Kawamata</strong>, <strong>Reid</strong>, <strong>Kollár</strong>, <strong>Birkar</strong>, and others.</p>
<hr />
<p>However, the <strong>Minimal Model Program (MMP)</strong> was still far from complete, since there are three types of contractions, and in one of them the image is not klt (recall that klt requires <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> to be <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>-Cartier):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Fibre contraction</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(\dim \mathrm{cont}(X) &lt; \dim X\)</span>.
In this case, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a ruled variety over <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{cont}(X)\)</span>, corresponding to Mori’s first case (1981).</li>
<li><strong>Divisorial contraction</strong>: the exceptional locus of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{cont}\)</span> is a divisor, corresponding to Mori’s second case.</li>
<li><strong>Small contraction</strong>: the exceptional locus has codimension at least two, which does not occur for smooth threefolds.</li>
</ol>
<p>For small contractions, the image <span class="math inline">\(Y := \mathrm{cont}(X)\)</span> has a canonical divisor <span class="math inline">\(K_Y\)</span> that is <strong>not <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>-Cartier</strong>.
Indeed, if <span class="math inline">\(K_Y\)</span> were <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>-Cartier, then for any contracted curve <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> we would have
<span class="math display">\[
K_X \cdot l = \mathrm{cont}^*K_Y \cdot l = 0,
\]</span>
contradicting the fact that <span class="math inline">\(K_X \cdot l &lt; 0\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p>To solve this issue, one introduces a new variety <span class="math inline">\(X^+\)</span> satisfying certain properties, called a <strong>flip</strong>.</p>
<p>Here we give an example [KM, Example 2.7]</p>
<h3 id="example-of-flip">Example of flip</h3>
<p>Consider the three-dimensional algebraic variety
<span class="math inline">\(Y = \{(x, y, z, w) \in \mathbb{C}^4 \mid xy = zw\}\)</span>.
Recall that it has a <strong>log canonical singularity</strong> at the origin.
Let <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{X}\)</span> be the <strong>blow-up of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> at the origin</strong>.
By definition, the <strong>exceptional divisor</strong> <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is the surface
<span class="math inline">\(xy - zw = 0\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^3\)</span>.
This is a <strong>ruled surface</strong>, which can be viewed as the <strong>Veronese embedding</strong> of
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1\)</span>.
In other words, the two copies of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1\)</span> can be identified respectively with
<span class="math inline">\((x : z)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((y : w)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, consider the two three-dimensional varieties obtained by <strong>contracting each of the two different <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1\)</span>’s</strong> in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.
Denote them by <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X^+\)</span>.
By the universal property of blow-ups, there exist <strong>canonical morphisms</strong>
<span class="math inline">\(X \to Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X^+ \to Y\)</span>.
Let <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C^+\)</span> be the <strong>exceptional loci</strong> of these two morphisms.
By definition, both are isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^1\)</span>.</p>
<p>On <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, the locus <span class="math inline">\(y = w = 0\)</span> is contracted to a point, while <span class="math inline">\(x = z = 0\)</span> remains unchanged.
On <span class="math inline">\(X^+\)</span>, the situation is reversed: <span class="math inline">\(x = z = 0\)</span> is contracted to a point, while <span class="math inline">\(y = w = 0\)</span> remains unchanged.
The following diagram illustrates the situation.</p>
<p>Now consider the action of the cyclic group <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}^4\)</span>:
<span class="math inline">\((x, y, z, w) \mapsto (\zeta_n x, y, \zeta_n z, w)\)</span>,
where <span class="math inline">\(\zeta_n\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th root of unity.
This action preserves <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, and the fixed loci in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are the planes
<span class="math inline">\(x = z = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y = w = 0\)</span>.
Denote the quotient variety by <span class="math inline">\(Y_n\)</span>.</p>
<p>By the universal property of the blow-up, the action of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\)</span> also extends to <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{X}\)</span>.
Restricted to the exceptional divisor <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, the action preserves the two lines <span class="math inline">\(x = z = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y = w = 0\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{P}^3\)</span>.
Again by the universal property, this induces actions of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X^+\)</span>.</p>
<p>Denote the quotient varieties by <span class="math inline">\(X_n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_n^+\)</span>.
It can be seen that these two varieties have very different properties:
<span class="math inline">\(X_n^+\)</span> is <strong>smooth</strong>, while <span class="math inline">\(X_n\)</span> is <strong>singular</strong>.</p>
<p>We call <span class="math inline">\(X_n^+\)</span> the <strong>flip</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(X_n \to Y_n\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p>So now the question is: When flip exists? When it terminates?</p>
<p>In 1988, Mori proved the <strong>existence of flips in dimension three</strong>.</p>
<p>Major progress followed in the 21st century:
in 2003, <strong>Shokurov</strong> proved the existence of flips in dimension four;
in 2005, <strong>Hacon</strong> and <strong>McKernan</strong> showed that the existence of flips in dimension <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> implies their existence in dimension <span class="math inline">\(n + 1\)</span>, thus completing the proof of existence for dimension 4;
and in 2010, the famous paper BCHM established the existence of <strong>log flips</strong> and the <strong>termination</strong> of special flip sequences. But for general termination, the situation remains largely open — the most significant progress is due to <strong>Kawamata</strong>, who proved finiteness for three- and four-dimensional cases.</p>
<h3 id="theorem-bchm">Theorem (BCHM)</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(X \to U\)</span> be a projective morphism between normal quasi-projective varieties, and let <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> be a <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>-divisor such that <span class="math inline">\((X, \Delta)\)</span> is a klt pair.
Then there exists a <span class="math inline">\((K_X + \Delta)\)</span>-MMP on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> consisting of finitely many flips and divisorial contractions:
<span class="math display">\[
X = X_1 \dashrightarrow X_2 \dashrightarrow \ldots \dashrightarrow X_N
\]</span>
such that either <span class="math inline">\(K_{X_N} + \Delta_N\)</span> is nef over <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, or there exists a morphism <span class="math inline">\(X_N \to Z\)</span> which is a Mori fiber space.
(See [HK, Theorem 5.54].)</p>

<p>The target of this gt is study the proof of contraction theorem and the proof of BCHM.</p>
