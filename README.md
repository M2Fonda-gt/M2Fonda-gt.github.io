# Groupes de Travail - M2 Math√©matiques fondamentales

This repo contains the source for a website **managed by students**, used to track each work group lectures and references.

Feel free to contribute through pull requests, or send a message to someone with write access (a list will be added) !

## Disclaimer :
1. Do _not_ edit anything under `docs`, those files are automatically generated by [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). Don't edit the Cabal, Stack nor `site.hs` file, they generate the website content.
2. Binary files like PDFs do not behave nicely with `git`, they are to be sent (or made available) to someone with write access and stored locally. Another solution (to be discussed) is hosting them online (e.g. on [0x0.st](https://0x0.st)).
